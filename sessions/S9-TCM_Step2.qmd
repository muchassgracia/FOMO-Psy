# TCM steps

1. Identify definitions of constructs and relevant phenomena
2. **TODAY: Formulate a prototheory: Create a VAST display**
3. Develop a formal model:
   - Develop a Bischof control system display?
   - Implement in a programming language?
4. Check the adequacy of the formal model
   - Do sensitivity analyses etc.
5. Evaluate the overall worth of the constructed theory


# TCM Step 2: Formulate a prototheory / Sketch the existing verbal theory

Goal: Capture the core theoretical relationships - as proposed by the original authors - in a VAST display.

## Concrete steps

1. Search the literature for theoretical statements about relationships between constructs (only our focal constructs). 
2. **Deliverable 1**: 
   - Enter the theoretical statements in a table
     - Do this in a granular way: each table cell/box should only contain a single statement (which later get connected with different types of relationships). You can split long original sentences into separate atomic statements.
     - Back up all decisions with evidence (e.g., with direct quotes) or justifications (e.g., for deviations from the literature, or when the literature is ambiguous, or when you had to fill a gap). These justifications go into a narrative text that accompanies the VAST display.
   - Assign a unique ID to each statement. In the VAST display, add the ID to each relationship.
   - When you have to extend the original theory, or make some relationships more precise, add the new statements to the table, clearly indicate that this is a new statement from you, and also give it an ID.
3. **Deliverable 2**: Extend your existing VAST display. Concerning the arrows, make use of all possible relationship types (where appropriate). Not just "naming (n)" and "causation (c)", but also:  
    - Conceptual Implication (i)
    - Transformation (t)
    - Prediction (p)
    - Reasoning (r)
 
 Try to model the actual mechanisms and to avoid too big black boxes; e.g., what component of attitudes is exactly supposed to be manipulated?
4. **Deliverable 3**: Write a short paragraph with a meta-assessment of the task: How easy / feasible was it to find and extract the theoretical statements, and to convert them into a VAST display? What were the hurdles? What features of the primary literature were (not) helpful?

#### VAST display

The corresponding IDs from the "statement table" are shown in parentheses at each relationship arrow.

### Notes:

A conceptual implication contains multiple cases: 

- hierarchical relationships between categories (being a dog conceptually implies being an animal)
- but also attributes: Being a "sun" conceptually implies "being hot"
