# Final report

Your task is to formalize a psychological theory of your choice. 
The goal is *not* to do a complete formalization, but to demonstrate that you understand all methodological steps of the TCM (as we practiced it in the course) and that you are able to apply them to a new theory.

Hence, it is sufficient in each step to make an exemplary demonstration of the necessary steps, without the goal of being exhaustive.
Also, whether the final formalization makes sense or the formal model really produces the phenomenon is not part of the grading (because that also depends on the chosen theory). For grading, I only assess whether the methodological steps have been applied *lege artis* and a coherent report has been written (e.g.: do the steps meaningfully build upon each other? Do the conclusions follow from the presented evidence?).

## Step 0. Identify the focal constructs of your theory

- if the theory is large, or there are several versions: Limit yourself to the main theoretical relationships and constructs.

## Step 1. Identify relevant phenomena

*(for details, see [Session 8](S8-TCM_Step1.qmd))*.

- Search for at least 1 meta-analysis of your focal constructs
- Only if no meta-analysis available, or not helpful: Search for 2-3 exemplary primary studies. You do *not* have to conduct a full-blown meta-analysis.
- Based on this (limited, not exhaustive) literature: Assess the robustness of the phenomena. Give a clear answer "The phenomenon can (not) be considered robust because, ..." by referring to the two dimensions of robustness:
  - Strength of evidence
  - Generalizability (cf. UTOS framework)

Note: If the phenomena turn out to be not robust, there is no need to change your chosen theory. Just work with what you have.

## Step 2. Formulate a prototheory / Sketch the existing verbal theory

*(for details, see [Session 9](S9-TCM_Step2.qmd))*.

Create a VAST display

## Step 3. Develop a formal model:

- Program a small ABM
- Define mathematical equations
- 

## Step 4. Check the adequacy of the formal model
- Do sensitivity analyses etc.


## Step 5. Evaluate the overall worth of the constructed theory


# Formal stuff

- 15,000 characters is not much: Keep every step short and crisp and spot-on.
- You need to hand it a PDF, which is accompanied by a project on a repository (e.g., Github)
- Code, supplemental material, etc. goes into the repository.
