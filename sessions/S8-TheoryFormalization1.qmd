# TCM steps

1. [ ] Task 1: Identify relevant phenomena
2. [ ] Formulate a prototheory: Create a VAST display
3. Develop a formal model:
   - [ ] Develop a Bischof control system display?
   - [ ] Implement in a programming language?
4. Check the adequacy of the formal model
   - [ ] Do sensitivity analyses etc.
5. [ ] Evaluate the overall worth of the constructed theory


# Possible approaches

Formalization approaches can differ in their *starting point* (which often are not clear-cut distinct, but blurry):

- (A): **Start with the verbal theory**, formalize it as it is.
  - Interpret the verbal statements, make them more precise, visualize as a VAST display
  - Ignore empirical evidence (even if a hypothesized effect has already been empirically rejected, keep it in the model)
- (B1) - **TCM approach: Start with robust phenomena**, invent an explanatory theory and formal model
  - Ignore existing verbal theories (which might be hard once you know them)
  - This will (potentially) lead to an alternative theory/model to the existing theory
- (B2) - **Demiurg approach: Start with an adaptive problem**, construct an organism that is able to solve the problem
  - Potential (draft) formulation of an adaptive problem: "For social mammals, contact to other groups is both a source of opportunities (genetical diversity for mating, knowledge exchange, exploitation) and risks (getting exploited / killed, ...). Organisms need to decide when to get in intergroup contact (and )"
  - The design of the organism should be based on prior knowledge of capabilities and limitations of organisms
  - The adaptive problem often implicitly is informed by evidence and phenomena: We know that organisms are capable of solving that in some way.
- **A-B fusion**: Starting point is the narrative theory, but you limit your formalization to those aspects which are (a) theoretically central OR (b) relate to robust phenomena.


## Decisions we made together with the expert researcher:

For limiting the scope of the formalization exercise, we decided to focus on these variables:

- "Valence of imagination" as moderating variable: This is theoretically important, but there is conflicting empirical evidence (the valence doesn't seem to make a difference; see meta-analysis of [Miles & Crisp, 2014](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1368430213510573))
- Affective processes as mediating variable
  - Erst die Prozessvariablen machen aus der Hypothese eine Erklärung. Aber die Erklärung ist recht unterspezifiziert: was genau heißt "die Einstellung ändert sich". Was genau? Die Valenz? Der Inhalt? die gefühlte Distanz zur outgroup Eine Möglichkeit: Ängste reduzieren.
- Primary outcomes: 
  - "Im Kern der ursprünglichen Hypothese liegt die outgroup perception (welche ein Oberbegriff von "Einstellung" und/oder die "Vorurteile" ist (Einstellungen werden als Proxy für Vorurteile genommen)"
  - (Self-reported) approach tendencies
    - We do not model actual behavior, as this is too multi-determined. Hence, everything happens "within the mind" of the actors.



# Practical first steps:

- Work as one or two groups?
- Create a new Github repository for each group. Initialize with a README; create a `dev` branch, start working there.
- Create a markdown document (or multiple documents, for each task).

# Task 1: Identify relevant phenomena

Goal: Identify and define empirically robust phenomena.

Robust = ...
- strong empirical evidence
- generalizable (cf. UTOS framework): The effect has been shown for different [Units]{.hl}, with different operationalizations of [Treatments]{.hl} and [Outcomes]{.hl}, and in multiple [Settings]{.hl}

1. Search the two meta-analyses for our focal variables
2. Do a broader literature search for more evidence.
3. Assess the robustness:
   1. How strong is the evidence? (number *k* of studies in a meta-analysis, strength of evidence, risk of bias)
   2. How generalizable is it? Go through UTOS dimensions and evaluate which types of generalization have been shown.
4. Use the primary literature (the overview chapter and additional papers) to define our focal constructs. 
   1. Search for definitions, collect them in a document.
   2. Compare different definitions (maybe in a table?)
   3. Agree on consensus working definitions for the context of our project.
   4. Create a VAST display with naming relationships (copy & paste or paraphrase existing text)



# Speicher: What are robust phenomena

- Nationality und age für starke outgroup Effekte
  - Theorie ist agnostisch was die Art der Outgroup betrifft - die Theorie sagt für alle gleichermaßen den Effekt voraus.
(Ein möglicher Moderator wäre die Identifikationsstärke mit der Ingroup)
