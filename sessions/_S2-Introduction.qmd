# Homework 1 (individually) {#sec-homework}

Read van Dongen et al. (2022). Improving psychological explanations. *PsyArXiv.* [https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/qd69g](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/qd69g) and answer the following guiding questions:

1. What is the role an original authors should play when predictions are derived from a theory?

<!-- Answer: None. -->

2. Are phenomena, according to Bogen and Woodward, directly observable?

<!-- Answer: No. Although they are *established* by evidence from observations, they transcend any particular set of structured or unstructured data. -->

3. What is the role of statistical patterns in the Productive Explanation Model?

<!-- Answer: Statistical patterns are abstractions and generalizations of concrete structured data. They represent phenomena (i.e., they are their empirical anchor) and are produced by formal models. -->

4. List the three steps of productive explanation.

<!-- Answer: 
- Step 1: Represent the phenomenon as a statistical pattern.
- Step 2: Explicate the verbal theory as a formal model.
- Step 3: Evaluate whether the formal model produces the statistical pattern.
 -->

5. Does Model 3 of the Regulatory Resource Theory explain the ego-depletion effect?

<!-- Answer: 
With the specifically chosen parameters: Yes. But it "depends on a quite delicate balance between parameters that characterize the interplay between task demand and willpower." 
 -->

6. Not every explanation has the same quality. Describe the three quality criteria provided in the paper in one or two sentences each.

<!-- Answer:
Precision: Precise theories already specify many aspects of the formal model. Hence the set of formal models that are consistent with the verbal theory is relatively small.

Robustness: assess the impact of auxiliary assumptions that are necessary to specify a formal model but are not specified by the theory.

Empirical relevance: 
 -->


**Deliverable**: Submit answers to the guiding questions as a plain text/markdown file to the course's Github repo (go to `homework/session2` and upload an `.md` file with your name as filename). You can answer in English or in German. Most questions can be easily answered in one sentence. Feel free to copy and paste the relevant sentences from the paper. If you are tempted to use ChatGPT, better don't do the homework at all (after all, the goal of this exercise is that you *learn* something, not that you make your lecturer happy).


# Homework 2 (as a group)

- [ ] Create a CFF file and upload it to your group's subfolder
