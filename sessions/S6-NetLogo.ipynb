        "2. Implement your own model - start with a single donkey.\n",
        "     - Code together in the group - but every participant should write the code on their own local machine. Add your own name to the file name to distinguish different implementations. Save the `nlogo` files in the folder of your donkey.\n",
        "     - Group members can agree on a single implementation. But they can also have different irrelevant choices (such as the shape of the donkey), or even differing implementations (in case that the theoretical model was underspecified).\n",
        "3. For the first run: *A priori* choose sensible starting values for your free model parameters.\n",

        "**In this case, you can revise the theoretical model.** Change the model description in the `dev` branch and implement the changes.

        "3. Of those which survive, create offspring which has some random variation of their (single) parent (i.e., take the parameter settings of the surviving donkey, add some random noise to the settings, and create offspring with the updates settings) → **Mutation/Variation**\n",
