Instructor showcases how git works:

- Instructor creates a private project on Github for this course. This will be the central project for submitting homework.
- Students create their Github accounts; add them as contributors to the course project.
- Show how to commit, push, pull changes.
- Show a merge conflict (make a change in the web frontend and locally) and how to resolve it.
- We start the [OSC git tutorial](https://lmu-osc.github.io/Introduction-RStudio-Git-GitHub/) together to weed out technical hurdles. The rest of tutorial is homework.
-  (for the instructor:) Install the Draw.io app for the homework repository:
  -  Go to [github.com/apps/draw-io-app](https://github.com/apps/draw-io-app), and click Install.
  - If you want to install this app in specific repositories, click on Only select repositories.
