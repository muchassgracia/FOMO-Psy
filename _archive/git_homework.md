::: {.callout-note title="Instructions for lecturer"}
Open the presentation on [IT-Tools](../skills/it-tools/it-tools.qmd) and go through all slides that are related to `git`.

Lecturer showcases how git works:

- Lecturer creates a private project on Github for this course. This will be the central project for submitting homework.
- Students create their Github accounts; add them as contributors to the course project.
- Show how to commit, push, pull changes.
- Show a merge conflict (make a change in the web frontend and locally) and how to resolve it.
- We start the [OSC git tutorial](https://lmu-osc.github.io/Introduction-RStudio-Git-GitHub/) together to weed out technical hurdles. The rest of tutorial is homework.
