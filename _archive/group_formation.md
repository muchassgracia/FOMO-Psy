# Group formation {#sec-group_formation}

## Goal:

- Put together groups where also unacquainted people meet -> increase network size.
- Allow a certain freedom of choice, not completely random.
- Ensure that at least one person is knowledgable of programming.

## Create a "visual analog scale" (VAS) of programming skills in the room

While carrying their name tags, students find their position between two corners of the rooms, described as:

1. "No programming knowledge at all, I even forgot everything I learned about R programming in the first semester"
2. "I actively coded (in any language) in the last 3 months"

## Semi-randomised allocation:

- Collect all name tags, in the order of programming skills in the VAS.
- Build 4 working islands (push tables together).
- Distribute the name tags of the 4 most capable programmers in the room on the 4 tables.
- Then select the next 4 names, who choose an island to join. But only 1 person is allowed to join each island at each round.

## Round of introductions within the group (10 min)

- Task: Think of a funny name for a donkey. This will be the group's name.
- Give a more detailed introduction to the other group members:
  - Career goals / type of psychologist they want to become
  - Specific programming skills
