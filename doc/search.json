[…] A strong link between theories and hypotheses is best achieved by formalizing theories as computational models.”\n“Many of these proposals [i.e., method reforms] are helpful ideas for raising the standards of good research practice, primarily ensuring more trustworthy inferences on the empirical level of scientific inference — the level connecting observations to empirical generalizations. Our concern is that shoring up the strength of inferences on the empirical level does not by itself address deficits on the theory level — the level connecting empirical generalizations to theories.”\n\nOberauer & Lewandowsky (2019)\n\n\n\n\nOberauer, K., & Lewandowsky, S.

Most of the replication studies […] employed the CDQ [Choice Dilemma Questionnaire] as their stimulus set, and they generally had no trouble obtaining the basic risky shift result.”\nToday we know that there is no risky shift. “It is now clear that the items contained in the original CDQ are in no sense a representative sample of the universe of all possible items. Instruments similar to the CDQ could readily be constructed whose scores would display risky shifts, cautious ones, or none at all” (Cartwright, 1971, p. 368).\nIn the early risky shift literature, theoretical progress was unnecessarily impeded by multiple generations of replication studies (k ⋍ 200), nearly all relying on the same CQD questionnaire.\n\n\n\n\nSee Westfall et al. (2015).

It is a phenomenon of this specific stimulus set (outcome operationalization) and suggests certain types of research questions (e.g., “What is so specific to this stimulus set?”)."

    "text": "“Addressing the theory crisis in psychology”\n\n\n“We argue that a further cause of poor replicability is the often weak logical link between theories and their empirical tests. […] A strong link between theories and hypotheses is best achieved by formalizing theories as computational models.”\n“Many of these proposals [i.e., method reforms] are helpful ideas for raising the standards of good research practice, primarily ensuring more trustworthy inferences on the empirical level of scientific inference — the level connecting observations to empirical generalizations. Our concern is that shoring up the strength of inferences on the empirical level does not by itself address deficits on the theory level — the level connecting empirical generalizations to theories.”\n\nOberauer & Lewandowsky (2019)\n\n\n\n\nOberauer, K., & Lewandowsky, S.

    "text": "2.4 (optional) Many donkeys: Parameter optimization\nIn NetLogo, it is very easy to create many agents of the same kind. Instead of manually optimizing the free parameters, you can use algorithms, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to find the best parameter settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAlways keep in mind: Evolution needs (a) variation (usually induced by mutation or recombination) and (b) selection.\n\n\nMany optimization algorithms are possible; here are some suggestions (with increasing complexity).\n\n2.4.1 Who survives the longest?\n\nCreate many Donkeys with varying settings of their parameters (i.e. in the setup function for the donkeys). Some possibilities for creating variation:\n\n“Random search”: Set parameters randomly within the allowed parameter range.\n“Grid search”: Create systematic combinations all parameters.\n\nRun the simulation, see which donkeys survive the longest.\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Evolutionary algorithm\n\nCreate many Donkeys with varying settings of their parameters (see above)\nAfter some time let the worst-performing die (i.e., those who are dead anyway, or have the lowest health value) → Selection\nOf those which survive, create offspring which has some random variation of their (single) parent (i.e., take the parameter settings of the surviving donkey, add some random noise to the settings, and create offspring with the updates settings) → Mutation/Variation\n\nNetLogo has many built-in functions for these evolutionary steps; for example:\n\nsetxy random-xcor random-ycor: Let agents start at a random position\nhatch is a primitive that creates a provided number of identical copies of a turtle (i.e., the offspring). It allows optional rules defined for the new turtles by following it with brackets [] (see help page).\nmax-n-of and min-n-of: Select the n agents with the highest or lowest value in a property (see help file). Here’s some pseudo-code, selecting the 10 buris with the highest and lowest value in health:\n\n; reproduction: the 10 fittest buris reproduce (2 kids)\nask max-n-of 10 buris [health] [\n\n  ; save the value of property1 of the parent in a variable\n  let prev_property1 property1\n\n  ; create 2 offsprings with random variation\n  hatch 2 [\n    lt 45  ; turn away\n    fd 1   ; walk away from parent to make it visible\n\n    ; add random variation to property1 of the offspring\n    set property1 prev_property1 - 0.025 + random-float 0.05\n    output-print (word \"Old property1: \" prev_property1 \"; new property1: \" property1)\n  ]\n]\n\n; death: the 10 unfittest buris die\nask min-n-of 10 buris [health] [\n    die\n]\nMonitor the distribution of parameter settings in the population of donkeys: Across evolving generations, it (often) will converge to the optimal values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExcept for an exhaustive search that enumerates all possible combinations of the entire parameter space, there’s no guarantee that optimization algorithms converge to the (globally) optimal solution. For example, they can get stuck in local optima. In this case, larger mutations in an evolutionary algorithm are helpful, because they allow to “jump” out of the local minimum/maximum and to find a better solution.\n\n(Image from http://turingfinance.com)"

    "text": "This is the email I sent to the colleagues in my department:\n\nSubject: We formalize your theory!\n\nBody:\nDear colleagues,\nthis semester, we want to explore something new. In my upcoming Empra (for 5th semester students), the participants get acquainted with formal modeling of psychological theories. The goal is to develop a mathematical or agent-based model of a verbal theory. In this project, …\n\nthe central phenomena are listed (What is to be explained?)\nthe verbal theory is explicated, and\na theory formalization is attempted (in a way that data can be simulated from the model).\n\nWe wanted to ask you - the colleagues in the department - if you want to submit a theory for this exercise.\nHere are some FAQs:\n\nWhat theory would be a good fit?\n\nA theory that is sufficiently precise and has a defined and not too large scope\nIts core premises are formulated in a clear and concise form on one (or only few) pages.\nThere doesn’t exist a formalized theory yet (e.g., it would be hard to re-create decades of theory building on the drift-diffusion model within a single course).\n\n\n\nWhat theory would not be a good fit?\n\nYou need to read three books to understand the theory.\nThe “all-encompassing theory of human nature”\nYou need a lot of expert input and judgement to fill in the gaps of the underspecified theory.\nYou need very specific domain knowledge to even understand the basic phenomena and constructs of the theory.\n\n\n\nBut don’t you lack domain knowledge?\nIn an ideal world, theories are so well specified that they can be formalized without further expert opinions. But as this is unrealistic in psychology, we need your input (see next question).\n\n\nWhat is my necessary commitment?\n\nProvide the written material for the theory.\nTwo or three meetings (each lasting ~2h) during the Empra’s teaching hours (XXX):\n\nMeeting 1 where you give a very short overview of the theory (after the students have already read the written material) and we discuss first steps.\nMeeting 2 where students present intermediate results and can ask questions for clarification.\n(optional) Meeting 3, where students present their results to you.\nIf you enjoy and benefit from the scientific discussion, of course more meetings are possible and welcome.\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens with the results?\nThe created models will be published with a CC-BY license. That means, you can reuse everything with a proper citation. If the models are really helpful (and more than just a vague inspiration for further work), we can think about a follow-up collaboration and write-up (where collaboration and co-authorship is offered to the student creators of the model).\n\n\nThe procedure would be as follows:\n\nWe collect candidate theories for formalization until 30.10.2023.\nWe screen all submissions and select one or two theories (depending on their complexity).\nIf your theory is selected, we will meet:\n\nFor the introductory meeting (xx.xx.2023, ~2h)\nFor the intermediate meeting (xx.xx.2024, ~2h)\nFor the results presentation (xx.xx.2024, ~2h)\n\n\nIf you want to participate, please send an email to xxx by xx.xx.2023, containing a short description of the theory (max. 200 words) and a link to a central paper describing the theory. It can be “your” theory, or an existing theory that you work with.\nA final caveat: We are aware that this collaboration requires a non-negligible time investment from you. At the same time, this is highly experimental and we cannot promise any success or even progress. But in any case we expect good scientific discussions and are convinced that the exercise is fruitful for all parties.\nIf you have any questions, drop me an email.\n\nHere are some (anonymized) reactions I got:\n\n“EPIC!”\n“A very good idea. Just trying it would fulfil my heart’s desire”\n\nAt the end, XX theories got submitted. We discussed them and selected YY of them"

    "text": "Im Empirisch-psychologischen Praktikum “Formale Modellierung in der Psychologie” tauchen die Studierenden in die Welt der quantitativen Darstellung psychologischer Theorien ein. Dabei geht es nicht um die quantitative Auswertung von Daten mit Hilfe statistischer Modelle, sondern um Theorien und datengenerierende Modelle, die so präzise sind, dass man konkrete Daten vorhersagen kann.\nAls eine Reaktion auf die Replikationskrise wurde der Ruf nach besseren Theorien laut, mit dem Ziel, verbale und konzeptionelle Theorien in formale, mathematische Modelle zu übersetzen. Diese Modelle dienen mehreren Zwecken: Sie ermöglichen eine rigorose Prüfung von Hypothesen, bieten klarere Vorhersagen und bilden einen Rahmen, um scheinbar disparate Ergebnisse zu vereinheitlichen. Außerdem schärfen sie den Blick auf “Leerstellen” in den meist hoffnungslos unterspezifizierten Theorien in der Psychologie.\nIn diesem Kurs werden die Studierenden in die grundlegenden Prinzipien der formalen Modellierung und ihre verschiedenen Varianten eingeführt (z.B. mathematische Modelle, Regelkreismodelle, agentenbasierte Modelle) und mit den Werkzeugen ausgestattet, die sie benötigen, um aus vorhandenen verbalen Theorien Modelle abzuleiten. Entsprechend werden wir uns viel mit der Implementierung in Programmiersprachen befassen. Wir werden dabei vermutlich viel in R programmieren, ggf. auch in NetLogo (für ABMs).\nWir werden versuchen, kollaborativ verbale psychologische Theorien soweit zu formalisieren, dass man sie in ein datengenerierendes Modell übersetzen und implementieren kann, um die generierten Daten dann zur Prüfung mit echten Daten zu vergleichen.\nWir werden Aspekte der Qualitätssicherung bei diesem Forschungsaspekt diskutieren und anwenden (Reproduzierbarkeit, Versionskontrolle, Sensitivitätsanalysen, gut dokumentierter Code / unit testing).\nDas Empra stellt etwas höhere Anforderungen an mathematisches und formales Denken, sowie ihre Programmierfähigkeit. Als Minimum werden die R-Kenntnisse vorausgesetzt, die im Rahmen der Seminare zu Statistik 1 und 2 gelehrt wurden, sowie die Bereitschaft, sich auch selbständig (anhand von bereitgestelltem Material) in Themen der Programmierung einzuarbeiten."

    "text": "Liebe Studierende,\nich freue mich schon auf unser Empra zur formalen Modellierung psychologischer Theorien. Hier kommen einige Hinweise für den Start:\n\nIch würde gerne den Start von 8:15 auf 8:30 verlegen. Die Sitzung geht dann bis 11:45.\nWir werden in fast jeder Sitzung am Computer arbeiten - z.B. Code schreiben, Diagramme zeichnen, oder Dateien in git einchecken. Daher wäre es gut, wenn sie, wenn möglich, immer ihren Laptop mitbringen. Wenn Sie keinen Laptop haben, können Sie auch bei Kommilitonen reinschauen und im “pair programming” Modus arbeiten.\nWenn das letzte Programmieren in R schon etwas länger her ist, frischen sie gerne vorab ihre Kenntnisse auf. Das Empra wird keine Auffrischung in R beinhalten. Hier sind einige Ressourcen:\n\nDie Tutorialfolien aus Statistik 1\nMoodle Kurs “R Tutorials”. Am Lehrstuhl Sozialpsychologie wurden R-Tutorials (Skript englisch, begleitende Videos deutsch) erstellt. Die Tutorials helfen, einen Anfang in R zu finden und zeigen die Durchführung ein paar üblicher Schritte der Datenaufbereitung und -auswertung. Passwort für den Moodle-Kurs: allyouneedisR\nYouTube-Video: “Want to learn R (#rstats) in 4 hours with NO programming experience?”\nhttps://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf (12 page PDF document)\nhttps://github.com/jobreu/r-intro-gesis-2021 (5 day course: slides & exercises)\n\nDie Kommunikation wird ab jetzt über den Moodle-Kurs laufen: https://moodle.lmu.de/course/view.php?id=30162 Der Einschreibeschlüssel lautet: “theorie”. Bitte schreiben Sie sich schon zeitnah ein; ich verschicke ab jetzt die Emails über den Kurs.\n\nDann sehen wir uns am Freitag, 20.10.23, um 8:30 in Raum 1208 zur ersten Sitzung! Bei Fragen können Sie sich gerne auch vorab schon bei mir melden.\nViele Grüße, Felix Schönbrodt"

    "section": "How to jointly assess “strength of evidence” and “generalizability”",
    "text": "How to jointly assess “strength of evidence” and “generalizability”\nThe strength of evidence relates to the question, how conclusive the empirical evidence is with regard to the question of generalizability.\nWhen you assess the generalizability, you should distinguish three prototypical epistemic states:\n\n“I know that it is generalizable.”\n“I know that it is not generalizable.”\n“I do not know whether it is generalizable or not - with the given empirical evidence I cannot answer this question.”\n\nWhen is the strength of evidence strong? If …\n\nyou have many studies,\nthat cover a considerable part of the space of possible generalizations,\nwhich are methodologically sound (i.e., valid),\nand show (at least in sum) a decisive statistical result into either direction (i.e., either for a difference, or for a null effect)\n\nAs a sidenote: Ideally, evidence is quantified with a statistical technique that also allows to measure evidence for the null hypothesis and that gives a continuous quantification of the strength of evidence. A Bayes factor provides both desiderata.\nAs the strength of evidence can be continuous, the situation can be visualized on a graph (see Figure 1):\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Possible results of a generalizability assessment.\n\n\nWe describe six prototypical examples:\n\n(A): Many variations have been tested and led to very different results, maybe even with a sign flip. This is strong evidence that the phenomenon is not generalizable.\n(B): Many variations have been tested and all led to comparable results. This is strong evidence that the phenomenon is generalizable - at least within the space of sampled variations.\n(C): Few variations have been tested and led to quite different results. This is weak evidence that the phenomenon is not generalizable.\n(D): Few variations have been tested and all led to comparable results. This is weak evidence that the phenomenon is generalizable. As we don’t know about the untested variations, the evidence principally cannot be very strong.\n(E): Only one variation has been tested. It is principally unknowable whether the result generalizes to other variations; the evidence is totally inconclusive. We can only conclude that we cannot conclude anything about generalizability. This also implies, that the question of generalizability cannot be answered if only a single (or very few) studies are available, or if the existing studies have no variation in the respective UTOS dimensions.\n(F): Although many variations have been tested, the evidence is still inconclusive. There are descriptive differences between variations, but they are small, and it is not clear if these differences are statistically significant and substantial.\n\nThe dashed line symbolizes the space of possible combinations: With a very small count of realized variations, it is very unlikely (or even impossible) to generate strong evidence in either direction.\nAn open question of course is, how close results should be to speak of high generalizability? Do the results in the right half of the plot have to be nearly identical? How much heterogeneity is allowed?\n\nApplying the heuristic to ManyLabs2\nAll four UTOS dimensions can get an independent assessment. Consider the ManyLabs2 study: The identical experiment (except translation of materials) has been administered online in very diverse samples (at least diverse with respect to nationality and cultural background). Hence, there was high variation in the U(nits) and the S(ettings) dimensions, but very low variation in the T(reatment) and O(utcome) dimension. Non-zero effects could be found with remarkably low variability across samples: “Cumulatively, variability in the observed effect sizes was attributable more to the effect being studied than to the sample or setting in which it was studied” (quoted from the Abstract).\nHence, a stylized analysis of the ML2 study could look like:\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A generalizability assessment of the UTOS dimensions in ManyLabs 2.\n\n\nHence, we have strong evidence for high generalizability for the U and the S dimension, but we cannot make a conclusion concerning the T and the O dimensions, as they lacked the necessary variation in the study."

References To Theory Are Not Theory\n(Note: While the following features of a scholarly article do not constitute a theory, they might be important in their own right)\n\n\nA manuscript that Robert Sutton edited had strong data, but all three reviewers emphasized that it had “weak theory” and “poorly motivated hypotheses.” The author responded to these concerns by writing a new introduction that added citations to many papers containing theory and many terms like “psycho-social theory,” “identity theory,” and “social comparison theory.”\nBut it still contained no discussion of what these theories were about and no discussion of the logical arguments why these theories led to the author’s predictions. The result was that this paper contained almost no theory, despite the author’s assertion that much had been added.\n\nSolution:\n\nAuthors need to explicate which concepts and causal arguments are adopted from cited sources and how they are linked to the theory being developed or tested.\n\n\n\nSutton, R.

Every act of self-control reduces the amount of willpower, so that one’s ability to inhibit or suppress the next unwanted impulse is diminished\nThe theory is said to explain the phenomenon of ego depletion: people perform worse on a task that requires self-control, right after having done something else that used this resource.\n\n\n\nAbridged from van Dongen et al. (2022).
