## Where do theories come from?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width='70%'}
- Falsificationism starts with a (tentative) theory, which is repeatedly tested, refuted, and refined.
- But where does the initial theory come from? "Flair"? Flash of inspiration in the shower?
- Popper did not care much about the first stage of creating theories - just about the later testing of theories.


**Conjecture**: We have a refined methodology¹ to *test* theories (e.g., experimental designs, statistical methods, preregistration, ...). [But we had (so far) no good methodology for constructing theories.]{.hl}

**Phenomena**: Stable and general features of the world in need of explanation. Can be understood as robust generalizations of patterns in empirical data. They are the explanatory targets for scientific theories (the *explanandum*). In psychology often called "effects".

**Data**: Relatively direct observations. Refer to *particular* empirical patterns in concrete data sets rather than empirical generalizations (which would be phenomenona).

**Theories**: Something that explains phenomena of interest (the *explanans*).

# What is a [theory]{.alert}?

> Like so many words that are bandied about, the word theory threatens to become meaningless. Because its referents are so diverse - including everything from minor working hypotheses, through comprehensive but vague and unordered speculations,to axiomatic systems of thought - use of the word often obscures rather than creates understanding.

1. References Are Not Theory

> A manuscript that Robert Sutton edited had strong data, but all three reviewers emphasized that it had "weak theory" and "poorly motivated hypotheses." The author responded to these concerns by writing a new introduction that added citations to many papers containing theory and many terms like "psycho-social theory," "identity theory," and "social comparison theory."
> 
>  **But it still contained no discussion of what these theories were about and no discussion of the logical arguments why these theories led to the author's predictions.** The result was that this paper contained almost no theory, despite the author's assertion that much had been added.

Solution:

> Authors need to explicate which concepts and causal arguments are adopted from cited sources and how they are linked to the theory being developed or tested.

3. Lists of Variables or Constructs Are Not Theory

> Papers [...] often are written as if well-defined variables or constructs, by themselves, are enough to make theory. Sometimes the list of variables represents a logical attempt to cover all or most of the determinants of a given outcome or process.

> Such lists may be useful catalogs of variables that can be entered as predictors or controls in multiple regression equations [...], but they do not constitute theory.

Lists of constructs (without an explicit definition of their causal relationship) often are called a *framework*.

4. Diagrams (Alone) Are Not Theory

> Diagrams or figures can be a valuable part of a research paper but also, by themselves, rarely constitute theory. Probably the least theoretical representations are ones that simply list categories of variables such as "personality," "environmental determinants," or "demographics." 
> 
> More helpful are figures that show causal relationships in a logical ordering, so that readers can see a chain of causation or how a third variable intervenes in or moderates a relationship. Also useful are temporal diagrams showing how a particular process unfolds over time. [...]
> 
> As Whetten (1989) suggested, while boxes and arrows can add order to a conception by explicitly delineating patterns and causal connections, they rarely explain *why* the proposed connections will be observed. Some verbal explication is almost always necessary.

**Data**: Relatively direct observations. Refer to *particular* empirical patterns in concrete data sets rather than empirical generalizations (which would be phenomenona).

**[Explanatory]{.alert} Theories** are constructed to explain the empirical phenomena that are evidenced by data (i.e., they are the *explanans*). Explanatory theories can be expressed in terms of a set of linked propositions referring to latent psychological constructs. At least one of these propositions expresses a general principle.

> “theory T putatively explains phenomenon P” means “if the world were as T says it is, P would follow as a matter of course.” Although this notion of explanation is arguably incomplete, it has the advantages of being close to the commonsense understanding of the concept and being easy to implement in a formal model—namely by creating a virtual world in which theory T is true and showing that this world will indeed produce phenomenon P.

::: {.callout-important}
# What is an (explanatory) theory?
A theory is a set of statements about the relationship(s) between two or more constructs with a nomological (i.e. law-like) character. (*explanans*)

::: {.callout-important}
# What is an explanation?
In the *productive explanation framework*, a theory T putatively explains a phenomenon P if and only if a formal model of the theory T produces a statistical pattern representing the empirical phenomenon P.

## Elements of a theory

::: {.r-fit-text}
- **Phänomen**: Eine Eigenschaft der Welt, die hinreichend wenig flüchtig ist, so dass wir diese wahrnehmen und beschreiben können (Explanandum einer Theorie)
- **Begriff / Konzept**: Semantische Einheit (Konzept), die die Merkmale eines Gegenstandes oder Sachverhaltes vereint. ≠ Wort/Wortmarke
- **Relationship**
- **Modell**: Vereinfachte Abbildung eines Ausschnitts der Wirklichkeit. Alle Strukturen, die die Sätze einer Theorie erfüllen, sind Modelle dieser Theorie. Oder andersherum ausgedrückt: Eine Theorie kann meist in verschiedenen Modellen implementiert werden, die alle kompatibel zur Theorie sind.
- **Operationalisierung**: Präzise Angabe (inkl. Begründung), wie ein Begriff (s.o.), zu messen ist. 
- **Daten**: Daten sind öffentliche Aufzeichnungen, die durch Messungen und Experimente erzeugt werden und als Beweis für die Existenz oder Merkmale von Phänomenen dienen. (Woodward, 2009). Daten enthalten das Phänomen, an dem wir interessiert sind, aber auch Rauschen (Messfehler, Verzerrung durch den Experimentator, Transkriptionsfehler). Deshalb erklären Theorien die Phänomene, nicht die Daten. (Fried, 2021)

# TCM: Concrete Steps

::: {.r-fit-text}
1. Identifying relevant phenomena 
2. Formulating a prototheory
   a. This includes defining the constructs as a first step
3. Developing a formal model
4. Checking the adequacy of the formal model
5. Evaluating the overall worth of the constructed theory

::: {.callout-note}
This methodology is "structured creativity" - you are allowed to tinker around as much as you like. The five steps are mere tools that help to structure your creative process.
:::

:::

## TCM: Step 1

1. Identifying relevant phenomena 

> „The phenomena most useful in theory building are not necessarily the most spectacular ones. Instead, it is vitally important to select phenomena that are well established, or even self-evident, because a solid foundation is essential to successful theory construction.“

::: footer
Borsboom et al., 2021, p. 760
:::


## TCM: Step 2

2. Formulating a prototheory

> „Of the steps in TCM, the step of generating prototheories is the least methodologically developed. One methodological approach that is available is analogical abduction: If one finds a similar set of phenomena in another field that is better understood, then one can “borrow” explanatory principles from that field to inform one’s own.“

3. Developing a formal model

::: footer
Borsboom et al., 2021, p. 761
:::


## TCM: Step 4

4. Checking the adequacy of the formal model

- "To investigate this question, one must parse the phenomena in the same formal language as the theory. This means that the phenomena themselves have to be formalized."
- Before you observe any real data, ask (and test): *Does the model even work in principle?*
  - Simulate data from the model
  - Does it produce the target phenomena?
  - Sensitivity analysis: What happens if parameters of the model are changed / pushed to the extreme? When does it break?

- Which phenomena can be actually produced by the model? (Assuming that multiple phenomena are predicted)
- Which choices of the model are arbitrary?
- Sensitivity analysis: How robust is the explanation across (realistic) changes of parameter settings?
- Explanatory relevance: Are the explanatory principles actually necessary to explain phenomena? (e.g., it could happen that you remove an element in the model, and the phenomenon still is produced.)

## "Makeism"

::: {.callout-note}
# What is makeism?

Makeism: The view that computationalism implies that (a) it is *possible* to (re)make cognition computationally; (b) if we (re)make cognition then we can *explain* and/or understand it; and possibly (c) explaining and/or understanding cognition *requires* (re)making cognition itself.

Note that it is especially easy for makeists to fall into map-territory confusion - mistaking their modeling artefacts for cognition itself - due to the view that the made thing *could* be cognition.
