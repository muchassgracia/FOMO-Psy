## Note

This presentation is a stump. Please use Daniel [Leising's slides](doc/Leising_2023_VAST.pdf).

## Fuzziness

- The goal are *precise* theories - but in reality, they often are (at least partially) vague and fuzzy
- VAST allows to make this fuzziness explicit by allowing vague quantifiers of relationship strength, e.g. "weakly positive", "strong"
  - Better than assigning an arbitrary, pseudo-precise number
  - It's about formalizing the current state/precision of a verbal theory - if it is imprecise, let's show it!
- Show gaps and underspecifications

## Explicate different perspectives and analysts

- Whose perspective is displayed?
- Who made the analysis?
  - E.g. Analyst Robert displays the perspective of Berta:

TODO Show example.

- give a scale to every variable (e.g. by defining it's measurement/operationalization)
