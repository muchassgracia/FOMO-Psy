## Note

This presentation is a stump. Please use Daniel [Leising's slides](doc/Leising_2023_VAST.pdf).

## Fuzziness

- The goal are *precise* theories - but in reality, they often are (at least partially) vague and fuzzy
- VAST allows to make this fuzziness explicit by allowing vague quantifiers of relationship strength, e.g. "weakly positive", "strong"
  - Better than assigning an arbitrary, pseudo-precise number
  - It's about formalizing the current state/precision of a verbal theory - if it is imprecise, let's show it!
- Show gaps and underspecifications

## Explicate different perspectives and analysts

- Whose perspective is displayed?
- Who made the analysis?
  - E.g. Analyst Robert displays the perspective of Berta:

TODO Show example.

## Notes on the different types of relationships

- Relationships between constructs can be ...
	- on a theoretical level. Then it's typically a causal path (c)
	- on empirical level: A relationship has been found! This is a prediction path (p)
	- Research cycle: One author's p-path is the next author's theoretical c-path
- Consider what you want to formalize:
  - A certain author's theoretical point of view at a certain point in time?
  - Or your personal, current point of view?
  - The empirical support for a statement?
  
## Theory vs. Model

In order to translate a theory into a model, one needs to ...

- give a scale to every variable (e.g. by defining it's measurement/operationalization)
